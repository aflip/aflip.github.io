# Hi, I'm Anand Philip

<p class="large-p">
I'm a family physician interested in how information technology can improve (or worsen) decision making in and outside healthcare. 
</p>
This fuels **Bold**, my health-tech R&D practice where I build tools for my clients using the best technology for the problem. Sometimes these are ML/AI models and sometimes these are guidelines.

<h3>Ethics [{{< fa book-open-reader >}}](#ethics)</h3>
I have put togeter a basic reading list and explanation of the main schools of thoughts about [Ethics in AI ](https://anandphilip.com/ethical-ai-basic-reading-schools-of-thought-an-overview/) \[external link\]

I am editing an [Anthill Inside session on AI and Risk Mitigation](https://hasgeek.com/anthillinside/ai-and-risk-mitigation/).  My co-editor [Dr. Hannah Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-mary-thomas-t-838a0113/?originalSubdomain=in) and I are working with Health-AI companies to develop priorities, guidelines and resources for the use of AI in healthcare in India. 

- [AI Challenges in Radiology](https://hasgeek.com/anthillinside/navigating-ai-challenges-in-radiology/) A discussion with 5C Network
- [Ethical Concerns in Use of AI in Healthcare](https://hasgeek.com/anthillinside/ethical-concerns-in-use-of-ai-in-healthcare/) A discussion with Dr. Olinda Timms

<h3>Semantic Search [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/aflip/mood-muse)</h3> 

Last year I did a deep dive into semantic and vector based search, made a poetry recommendation app and generally had a bunch of fun learning a lot of new stuff. If you've ever wanted better search, semantic search is one of the solutions. This is an area I am actively working on.

- [What is semantic search and why do we want it.](blog/what-is-semantic-search/index.qmd) This is a non-technical explanation.  
- [Technical notes](blog/sem-search-notes/index.qmd) about semantic search and how to implement it
- The repo has training notebooks and more

<h3> Statistics [{{< fa brands github >}}](https://github.com/aflip/biostats-with-python)</h3></h3>


In collaboration with Medibuddy, I created a guide to conducting and selecting statistical tests using Python. This guide serves as a quick reference for their research team, promoting standardization and efficiency in research workflows. You can read the whole guide and run it on colab here: 

- [Parametric and non-parametric tests in {{< fa brands python >}} python](blog/biostat-with-python-01/01-BWP-deploy-bold.html)
- Watch the repo for further notebooks/installations as this is under active development
